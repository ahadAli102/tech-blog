				<p class="fs-5">A coroutine is a concurrency design pattern that
					you can use on Android to simplify code that executes
					asynchronously. Coroutines were added to Kotlin in version 1.3 and
					are based on established concepts from other languages. On Android,
					coroutines help to manage long-running tasks that might otherwise
					block the main thread and cause your app to become unresponsive.
					Over 50% of professional developers who use coroutines have
					reported seeing increased productivity. This topic describes how
					you can use Kotlin coroutines to address these problems, enabling
					you to write cleaner and more concise app code.</p>
